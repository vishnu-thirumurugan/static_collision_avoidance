# ML_TERM_PROJECT

# reproduced_paper
This folder contains a journal paper, which is about static collision avoidance problem. It is solved by using the q learning algorithm and is compared with classic A* and RRT path planning algorithm in nine different scenarios with different number of obstacles in each case.

I am planning to recreate this work for term project.

# RRT
This folder contains the RRT path planning algorihtm. It also contains images which shows how progressively, the algorithm is built.
