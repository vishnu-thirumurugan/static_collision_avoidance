The images in this folder shows how progressively the algorithm is built.


## IMAGE 2
This image shows, how nodes are created in a random fashion.
One worthy thing to note is that all the nodes are created in free space, where there is no obstacle.

## IMAGE 3
The nodes are connected by blue line as shown in this figure day 3. There are numerous nodes. But in actual, when we could find th goal point, we can terminate the node generation and announce that we had reached the goal point from the starting point. In RRT, the path is not actually optimal. So we introduce a bias method, which takes us towards the goal direction. The amount of bias depends on our application.
